<p><strong>Restaurant News</strong> &#8212; Samsung with new VXT CMS for AI-powered voice order menu boards going into White Castle. New digital-only Whataburger. Outdoor pickup. Nice case study with Aramark.</p>
<p><strong>ADA</strong> &#8212; December 2023 brings the new self-service &amp; POS guidelines from the U.S. Access Board. Several notable entries for Braille and screen-readers.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Buzz Around Our Watercooler</strong> &#8212; Couple of big deployments supposedly planned in restaurants. Charley’s is in progress and it might be Burger King will follow McDonald’s example and put in a thousand or so self-order kiosks. On the SCO front, it appears that Walmart is deploying its own SCO units (with lidar). That also would mean replacing the current software driving registers (Fastlane by NCR?). Our guess is the service people at NCR Bentonville are getting nervous. Costco is being sued for their website allowing all types of user info to be tracked by 3rd parties. Link below.</p>

<p>“With consumer awareness and demand for down payment assistance (DPA) programs on the rise, DPR has become an invaluable resource for lenders seeking to assist homebuyers to navigate the challenges posed by high interest rates and soaring home prices,” said Down Payment Resource Founder and CEO Rob Chrane. “It is with great pride that we welcome these lenders who have a shared commitment to growing homeownership in their communities by supporting homebuyer assistance programs.”</p>
<p>DPR&#8217;s robust solution for enterprise lenders comes equipped with four tools that streamline the operationalization of homebuyer assistance programs. The searchable DPA Directory enables product managers to curate programs that meet secondary market requirements, CRA compliance goals and community needs. The Loan Officer Portal automatically matches incoming borrowers to approved assistance programs. The Underwriter Portal provides quick access to program guidelines, and the Consumer Portal generates leads by inviting homebuyers to search for DPA.</p>
<p>“Purchasing a home is a major financial decision that requires careful consideration. At Elevations Credit Union, we understand the significance of this decision and are dedicated to supporting our members throughout the process,” said SVP Lending at Elevations Credit Union Elizabeth Million. “We are committed to our Colorado community and strive to make homeownership accessible for all our members, regardless of their circumstances. We recognize that obtaining a down payment can be a significant barrier to homeownership, and so we partner with down payment assistance providers to increase homeownership opportunities for all members, including those with low and moderate incomes, enabling us to continue investing in our Colorado community.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s important that our customers get the down payment assistance they need, so our partnership with DPR makes perfect sense,” said Brian Gilpin, CFO and Head of Capital Markets with Embrace Home Loans. “Working with DPR enhances our efforts to promote sustainable, affordable homeownership for underserved communities.”</p>
<p>“Homeowners Financial Group is committed to supporting our local communities. We are experts in local homebuyer assistance programs and strive to help everyone achieve the dream of homeownership,” said Chief Operations Officer at Homeowners Financial Group Nelson De Leon. “Our partnership with Down Payment Resource enhances our ability to match prospective homebuyers with affordable lending products and ensures an exceptional customer experience.”</p>
<p>“RWM is dedicated to helping as many people as possible achieve their dream of homeownership. We are proud to offer a variety of down payment assistance programs as a solution when the down payment is a barrier to purchasing a home,” said RWM Home Loans Director of Sales Success Victoria Nash. “Our partnership with Down Payment Resource allows us to keep track of all of our approved DPA programs, in one easy-to-use directory. The LO and Underwriting Portals are huge time-savers for our team so that they can focus on what really matters — finding DPA matches for our borrowers and helping them become homeowners much sooner than they thought possible. This is a great resource for loan officers, homebuyers, Realtors, underwriters, processors and anyone who is looking for more information on how they can utilize down payment assistance programs!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK, N.Y., Oct. 13, 2023 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) &#8212; A new AI detection bypassing tool, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bypassdetection.ai/">BypassDetection</a> has been launched recently designed to help people create undetectable AI writing effortlessly. It is set to ensure content creators can proceed with their efficient content creation process without the barriers of AI detectors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.send2press.com/wire/images/23-1013-s2p-BypassDetection-800x600.jpg" alt="BypassProtection - Bypass AI Detection" width="800" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-100891" srcset="https://www.send2press.com/wire/images/23-1013-s2p-BypassDetection-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.send2press.com/wire/images/23-1013-s2p-BypassDetection-800x600-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.send2press.com/wire/images/23-1013-s2p-BypassDetection-800x600-200x150.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br /><em>Image Caption: BypassDetection &#8211; A new AI detection bypassing tool.</em></p>
<p>BypassDetection CEO George Higdon stated, &#8220;Our anti-AI detection tool is set to revamp the ways of how content creators can use AI tools, unbinding them from current restrictions posed by AI detectors.&#8221;</p>
<p>BypassDetection uses a state-of-the-art algorithm that first analyzes the input text, then finds alternative words, phrases, and sentence structures that are unlikely to get detected as written by popular AI language models. It adjusts these elements to fit the context, effectively making the AI-generated text bypass AI detection.</p>
<p>BypassDetection has high success rates to bypass AI detection of all major AI content-checking software, including Copyleaks, GPTZero, Content at Scale, OpenAI’s Text Classifier, and ZeroGPT. It can humanize texts generated by any AI writing tool, such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Bard, making them effectively avoid the detection of those checkers.</p>
<p>This AI bypasser does much better in maintaining the content quality when creating undetectable AI writing. Its outputs are readable, free from grammatical or spelling errors, and ensure the original meaning is kept. Furthermore, it makes sure that rewrites are completely original. Its users won’t be at risk of getting in trouble with plagiarism checks using this tool.</p>
<p>BypassDetection can also benefit its users by improving the SEO-friendliness of their AI-generated content.</p>
<p>&#8220;With our effectiveness in bypassing AI detections, our tool can decrease the likelihood of your content being penalized because it&#8217;s generated by AI,&#8221; says George.</p>
<p>BypassDetection is designed to be novice-friendly and its users only need to go through a few simple steps to make undetectable AI writing. All they need to do to have content rewritten by BypassDetection is enter it into the tool, which will automatically and instantly rework the content to reduce the possibility of being detected as AI-generated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The launch of BypassDetection.ai marks a significant step forward in the AI writing industry,&#8221; added George. &#8220;We hope that it can provide a solution for those seeking to create writing that can bypass AI detection without compromising the quality of the content.&#8221;</p>
<p>BypassDetection can be tried for free. If you&#8217;re interested in testing out its performance, simply visit <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bypassdetection.ai/">https://bypassdetection.ai/</a>.</p>

<p>“HIX Bypass is a game-changer for anyone who uses AI-generated text. It will make sure that they get undetectable AI writing effortlessly and won’t have to worry about AI detection software,” says Camille Sawyer, CEO of HIX.AI.</p>
<p>There are several AI detection removers on the market, but many of them fail to bypass AI detection because they simply spin the content. This can mean the text will still be detectable and may lose quality and original meaning. Meanwhile, HIX Bypass leverages cutting-edge humanization technology to keep the quality of content and guarantee that AI detectors will be bypassed.</p>
<p>HIX Bypass&#8217; user interface has been curated to allow users to bypass AI detection as easily as possible. Users simply input their AI-generated text into the tool and can start the humanization process with one click. After the process is complete, users will have completely undetectable AI writing.</p>
<p>Moreover, HIX Bypass helps bypass AI detection while still preserving the quality of the writing. HIX.AI ensures that the original meaning of the text is preserved, and users won’t need to make edits to make sure their content delivers the messages they want. This makes sure that the user can always create undetectable AI writing that fits right in with the purpose of their content creation.</p>
<p>HIX Bypass is compatible with any AI-generated content. Whether the content has been written with assistance from ChatGPT, GPT-4, or Bard, AI detectors can be bypassed. This is also the case, whatever subject the content is written about.</p>
<p>Using anti-AI detection tools like HIX Bypass is also known to be helpful for the SEO of your website. AI texts humanized by HIX Bypass are easier to avoid the penalties from search engines. And it gives you a higher chance of maintaining the SEO rankings of your AI-generated content.</p>
<p>HIX Bypass has a high number of use cases and will attract a diverse usership. Primary use cases include content creation for blogs, websites, and social media, essay or report writing, marketing copy creation, and creative writing such as poems, stories, and scripts.</p>
<p>As seen from the features described above, HIX Bypass is far from just another AI bypasser in an already crowded market. It is unique and is set to redefine the AI detection bypassing game by harnessing the power of its undetectable AI writing technology to simultaneously bypass AI detection and improve the overall quality of written content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ATHENS, Ga., Oct. 13, 2023 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) &#8212; FormFree today announced the fourth quarter debut of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ffx.formfree.com">FormFree Exchange</a> (FFX®), a dynamic online marketplace that matches lenders with qualified borrowers for a faster, better and fairer lending experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.send2press.com/wire/images/22-0218-s2p-formfree-800x600.jpg" alt="FORMFREE" width="800" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79159" srcset="https://www.send2press.com/wire/images/22-0218-s2p-formfree-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.send2press.com/wire/images/22-0218-s2p-formfree-800x600-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.send2press.com/wire/images/22-0218-s2p-formfree-800x600-200x150.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br /><em>Image Caption: FormFree.</em></p>
<p>FFX has been meticulously designed to address the challenges facing lenders and borrowers in the modern financial landscape. With interest rates and home prices driving down loan application numbers and the prohibitive costs of lead generation eroding lender profitability, FFX offers a solution that reshapes lending as we know it.</p>
<p>&#8220;FormFree Exchange is where lenders meet qualified borrowers,&#8221; said Brent Chandler, founder and CEO of FormFree. &#8220;Our platform represents the future of lending, providing a transparent and efficient way for home, auto and consumer lenders to connect with high-intent borrowers. It&#8217;s not just about making loans; it&#8217;s about making lending accessible and profitable for all.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How FFX Works:</strong></p>
<p>FFX eliminates the need for lenders to sift through unqualified or unready leads by providing verified financial data from borrowers who have already demonstrated that they are ready and willing to transact using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.formfree.com/news-and-insights/formfree-and-kevin-harrington-launch-passport/">FormFree’s free Passport</a><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.formfree.com/news-and-insights/formfree-and-kevin-harrington-launch-passport/">®</a><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.formfree.com/news-and-insights/formfree-and-kevin-harrington-launch-passport/"> service</a>. Lenders receive this data in the form of an anonymous Qualified Borrower (QB) Medallion that empowers them to make competitive loan offers while protecting borrowers’ identities until an offer is extended and accepted.</p>
<p>Attributes provided in a QB Medallion include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intent</strong>: Understanding the borrower&#8217;s financial goals and requested loan type and amount</li>
<li><strong>Assets</strong>: Detailed account balances and transaction history</li>
<li><strong>Income</strong>: Validation of typical monthly income and income stability</li>
<li><strong>Employment</strong>: Verification of employment details and payment frequency</li>
<li><strong>ATP Analytics</strong>: In-depth ability-to-pay insights, including cash-flow index, Residual Income Knowledge Index® (RIKI)®, credit score and rent payment history</li>
<li><strong>CRA &amp; DPA Eligibility</strong>: Identification of borrowers eligible for down payment assistance and programs for low-to-moderate income and minority consumers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A More Inclusive Approach</strong></p>
<p>Outdated underwriting standards exclude millions of lendable consumers who have low FICO scores or nontraditional income but can sustainably support a mortgage. By providing a holistic view of each borrower’s finances, FFX allows lenders to help more consumers access the loans they need without taking on additional risk.</p>
<p>“Guild Mortgage is proud to be among the ten inaugural FormFree Exchange members who have signed up to be matched with motivated and creditworthy borrowers, many of whom would be weeded out and excluded from financing by traditional lead acquisition routes,” said David Battany. “We welcome this transparent model and feel confident in our ability to compete for the business of borrowers that are a good match for Guild.”</p>
