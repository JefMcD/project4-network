*quote* 
And now I will describe
in a figure the enlightenment or
unenlightenment of our nature:--Imagine human beings living in an
underground den which is open towards the light; they have been there from
childhood, having their necks and legs chained, and can only see into the
den. 

*quote*
At a distance there is a fire,
and between the fire and the
prisoners a raised way, and a low wall is built along the way, like the
screen over which marionette players show their puppets. 

*quote* 
Behind the wall appear moving figures, 
who hold in their hands various works of art,
and among them images of men and animals, wood and stone, and some of the
passers-by are talking and others silent. 

*quote* 
'A strange parable,' he said,
'and strange captives.' They are ourselves, I replied; and they see only
the shadows of the images which the fire throws on the wall of the den; 

*quote*
to these they give names, 
and if we add an echo which returns from the wall,
the voices of the passengers will seem to proceed from the shadows.

*quote*
Suppose now that you suddenly 
turn them round and make them look with pain
and grief to themselves at the real images; will they believe them to be
real? Will not their eyes be dazzled, and will they not try to get away
from the light to something which they are able to behold without
blinking? 

*quote*
And suppose further, 
that they are dragged up a steep and
rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself, will not their sight
be darkened with the excess of light? 

*quote*
Some time will pass 
before they get the habit of perceiving at all; and at first they will be able to perceive only shadows and reflections in the water; 

*quote* 
then they will recognize 
the moon and the stars, and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he is. 

*quote* 
Last of all 
they will conclude:--This is he who gives us
the year and the seasons, and is the author of all that we see. 

*quote*
How will they rejoice 
in passing from darkness to light! How worthless to them will seem the honours and glories of the den! 

*quote*
But now imagine further, 
that
they descend into their old habitations;--in that underground dwelling they will not see as well as their fellows, 

*quote* 
and will not 
be able to compete with them in the measurement of the shadows on the wall; there will be many jokes about the man who went on a visit to the sun and lost his eyes, 

*quote*
and if they find anybody 
trying to set free and enlighten one of
their number, they will put him to death, if they can catch him.

Now the cave 
or den is the world of sight, the fire is the sun, the way upwards is the way to knowledge, 

*quote*
and in the world 
of knowledge the idea of good is
last seen and with difficulty, but when seen is inferred to be the author
of good and right--parent of the lord of light in this world, and of truth
and understanding in the other. 

*quote* 
He who attains 
to the beatific vision
is always going upwards; 

*quote*
he is unwilling 
to descend into political
assemblies and courts of law; for his eyes are apt to blink at the images
or shadows of images which they behold in them--

*quote*
he cannot enter 
into the ideas of those who have never in their lives understood the relation of
the shadow to the substance. 

*quote* 
But blindness 
is of two kinds, and may
be caused either by passing out of darkness into light or out of light
into darkness, and a man of sense will distinguish between them, 

*quote*
and willnot laugh 
equally at both of them, 

*quote*
but the blindness which arises 
from fulness of light he will deem blessed, and pity the other; 

*quote*
or if he laugh at the puzzled 
soul looking at the sun, he will have more reason to laugh than the inhabitants of the den at those who descend from above.
